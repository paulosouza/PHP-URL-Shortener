Installation

1. Make sure your server meets the requirements:
    a) Optionally you can run this from your current domain or find a short domain
    b) Apache
    c) PHP
    d) MySQL
    e) Access to run SQL queries for installation
2. Download a .zip file of the PHP URL shortener script files
3. Upload the contents of the .zip file to your web server
4. Update the database info in config.php
5. Run the SQL included in shortenedurls.sql. Many people use phpMyAdmin for this, if you canâ€™t do it yourself contact your host.
6. Rename rename.htaccess to .htaccess
7. If you want to use the caching option, create a directory named cache with permissions 777

Using your personal URL shortener service

- To manually shorten URLs open in your web browser the location where you uploaded the files.
- To programmatically shorten URLs with PHP use the following code:
    $shortenedurl = file_get_contents('http://yourdomain.com/shorten.php?longurl=' . urlencode('http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']  . '/' . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']) . "&shorturl=" . $your_short_url );
